### Dreyfus Skill Assessment

* Rate yourself. Where do you see yourself in the Dreyfus model for the primary skills you use at work? List the ways your current skill level impacts you.
* Identify other skills where you are a novice, advanced beginner, and so on. Be aware of the possibility of second-order incompetence when making these evaluations.
* For each of these skills, decide what you need to advance to the next level. Keep these examples in mind as you read the remainder of this book.
* Think back to problems you’ve experienced on a project team. Could any of them have been avoided if the team had been aware of the Dreyfus model? What can you do differently going forward?

**A0&A1**: Writing and coding. In the former one I think I don't have the skill to get something tangible but I am also aware that it really depends on the experience. The coding, however, it's more tangible and there is a way to make it objective commpared to writing. So what I could say for both would be that I feel I am advanced beginner at writing while proficient in coding.

**A2**: Writing is simple. I just need more experience and feedback. LLM would help me get some but I also need to express myself in a way that I don't feel that I miss something. For coding, I need planning and feedback from myself to proceed.

**A3**: Being more open to this reality would make some problem more open to others. So, some problme would have been problems that could have been solved together rather than putting blame on each other. There was drastic issue I ccame across but knowing this model two years ago whould have helped me teaching.

### Simple Steps to Take

* Take a hard look at current problems on your project. Can you spot the different systems involved? Where do they interact? Are these interaction points related to the problems you’re seeing?
* Find three things you’ve analyzed out of context that caused you problems later.

**A0**: notebook based coding for R. use the results for writing as well.
Most of them reside in the notebook to get what's needed.
In order to get results, one has to run all file, there is no guide or separation of concerns.
Two similar datasets require two different files because there is an issue with relabeling, leading to be seen explicitly.
It cannot be reproduced if system is updated because library maintainers don't follow software guidelines. They follow what they think as good to them. One has to be sticked with the current version.


**A1**:

1) Missing documentation, which is the most important part of the development.
2) Need a summary of what has been done to continue from where I left.
3) Not documenting playground results. Failures are more common than success. What's failed has to be explicitly shown.

***Context matters has more power.***
