### Simple Steps to Take

* Take a hard look at current problems on your project. Can you spot the different systems involved? Where do they interact? Are these interaction points related to the problems you’re seeing?
* Find three things you’ve analyzed out of context that caused you problems later.



**A0**: notebook based coding for R. use the results for writing as well.
Most of them reside in the notebook to get what's needed.
In order to get results, one has to run all file, there is no guide or separation of concerns.
Two similar datasets require two different files because there is an issue with relabeling, leading to be seen explicitly.
It cannot be reproduced if system is updated because library maintainers don't follow software guidelines. They follow what they think as good to them. One has to be sticked with the current version.


**A1**:

1) Missing documentation, which is the most important part of the development.
2) Need a summary of what has been done to continue from where I left.
3) Not documenting playground results. Failures are more common than success. What's failed has to be explicitly shown.

***Context matters has more power.***
